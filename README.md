This project can either monitor and collect top news stories, or run every 24 hours to collect the top 10 news articles, summarize them, and send a bulk email to a list of recipients. This project utilizes the ChatGPT API and Brevo API.
monitor.py will check for any new articles that meet a "viral index" of >200. This is calculated by (**upvotes** + **number_of_comments**) / **age_of_post_in_secs**
